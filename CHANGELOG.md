## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `release verify` installs the version it is verifying instead of failing
  with "no solution found". The isolated install resolved from the local
  index cache, which still predates a version published moments earlier, so
  verifying a fresh release reported it as nonexistent.


## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- `release verify` reads a manifest whose digests are written as
  `sha256:<hex>`. Only the bare hexadecimal spelling was accepted, so a
  manifest from another gate was rejected as malformed.


## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-20

- All functionality and files.
