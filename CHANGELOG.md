## [Unreleased]

- Nothing worth mentioning right now.


## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- `release verify` reads a manifest whose digests are written as
  `sha256:<hex>`. Only the bare hexadecimal spelling was accepted, so a
  manifest from another gate was rejected as malformed.


## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-20

- All functionality and files.
